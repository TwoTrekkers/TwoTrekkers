## Top 7 Travel Tips
Here are some of top travel tips from TwoTrekkers, starting with the basics…

1. **Prepare your documents and do a little research.**
Make sure you have your passport, and find out what you need to do to get a visa, the cost, and how long it is for — do you need to apply in advance, online, on arrival? Do basic research on the country so you know what to expect — prohibited items, language, clothing requirements, safety, food, plug types and voltage…

2. **Pack smarter not harder.**
On our travels and moves to other countries, we’ve experienced the two ends of “fun” with luggage… struggling with way too many giant suitcases and small roller bags, to going for nearly a month trip with only a backpack each. We’ve learned to travel with what we really need, and not to worry too much about the rest! Having a few quality items is key… one of the most important is durable and versatile shoes! Do research on your destination to see what things you can easily purchase there, or what things are hard to find.

3. **E‑SIMs.**
This is by far the easiest method to stay connected as you travel. We use companies like Airalo and Nomad. You can purchase a plan for a country or group of countries in advance for a reasonable price, and then connect as soon as you land in your destination. No need to stress over finding a physical SIM card in an unfamiliar place or paying overpriced fees at the airport to get one.

4. **Learn some basic language.**
Wherever we’ve gone, the locals have always been more friendly and helpful when we’ve at least attempted to say a few words in their language. And for anything beyond the basics, be ready to use Google Translate!

5. **Get travel insurance.**
You never know if you might have an accident or unexpected health issue while traveling, or deal with flight delays, cancellations, or lost luggage. Squaremouth.com compares travel insurances based on your trip details. Our other favorites that can cover short trips or longer stays in foreign countries are Genki Insurance and SafetyWing.

6. **Research how to get around.**
Find out if you’re going to be able to easily take public transportation in your destination. Are there buses, metros, trikes, taxis, Uber? Can you rent bikes? Will you need a local app or travel card? Is it cheaper to rent a car? Can you drive in the country? Doing a little research on this beforehand can save you a lot of time and stress.

7. **Be a balanced planner.**
I tend to overthink and over plan. My husband would rather plan nothing, and explore once we arrive somewhere. We’ve found that somewhere in the middle leads to the most successful trips! Find a few key destinations and pin them on Google Maps. Get an idea of the things you definitely don’t want to miss and the general areas you’ll want to stay in and definitely book your accommodation beforehand. Then when you arrive, you’ll have in mind some things to see, but you won’t be so fixed on a schedule that you don’t have time to enjoy the unexpected wonders you may find!
