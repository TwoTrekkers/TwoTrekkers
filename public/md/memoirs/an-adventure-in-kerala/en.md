# Never Miss An Indian Wedding

## Introduction

Having visited India twice, both times for far too short of a visit, but for something unforgettable - the vibrant and colorful experience of Indian weddings, our second trip took us to the beautiful state of Kerala, known as “God’s Own Country.” This enchanting region is rich in natural beauty as well as cultural and religious diversity, with a large number of Hindus, Muslims, Christians, and followers of other religions all living amongst each other. Our adventure took place in the capital, Thiruvananthapuram (or Trivandrum, as it was previously named by the British), where we encountered the warmth and hospitality of the local Malayalis people.

_A little side note about airports in India: Indian airport security is always… an experience, to put it nicely. Any time we’ve had a layover in India, they’ve dumped nearly everything out of my purse into the same bin everyone puts their shoes in and rummaged through it, which has done nothing for my nerves or anxiety around germs. There’s a chaotic and informal sense of organization, and the staff somehow alternate between being callous, friendly, and serious all at once. Okay, I’ve had my rant—but once we learned what to expect, we did our best to go with the flow and keep a positive attitude!_

## Arrival and First Impressions

Upon arriving at the airport, we faced a few snags with our E-sims and ATM access, but the helpful airport taxi staff helped us out, and before we knew it, we were on our way. The kind taxi driver pointed out popular spots in the city along the way, to which we attempted our first Malayalam response, ”nandi”! (Thanks). Our Airbnb was a charming little place down a colorful backroad, perfect for our week-long stay. After settling in, we ventured out to find some local cuisine, specifically the delicious Chicken 65 that we had been introduced to on our previous visit to India and were once again craving, and of course, garlic naan! We also explored a nearby store with an extremely random assortment of things, where a thoughtful customer helped us communicate with the older shopkeeper. The main language is Malayalam, but many people also speak Tamil, Hindi, and English.

## Exploring Kerala

Our first full day began with giant coffees from the the very local coffee shop… Starbucks, and then a leisurely stroll through the nearby Kanakakkunnu Palace and the Sri Chitra Art Gallery, with their beautiful architecture and gardens. We enjoyed Paal paratha Chicken and Nadal Chicken Curry for lunch. Afterwards, we went to an Indian clothing store, and found a dashing kurta and jacket for the wedding! We also stumbled across an organic market with so many amazing foods, fruits, spices, and natural snacks, including the unique Gac fruit!

The next day we started off with a hearty brunch at City Queen, where we indulged in a traditional thali with chapati. Thali means “plate” and comes on a large platter with bread or rice and lots of little dishes that you can dip the bread in or eat with the rice. Speaking of, did you know there are at least 14 different types of flatbread in India? Later, we visited Kovalam Beach, where we enjoyed the stunning views and met a friendly family from “French India.” They shared stories about their hometown and the wedding they had just attended, which hosted around 850 guests!

The following day, we explored local markets, including the historic Connemara Market and the bustling Chalai Market. Nearby we discovered a treasure trove of spices and local delicacies. I never knew there were so many different kinds of cinnamon, dates, mangoes, and bananas! Our culinary journey continued at an Arabic restaurant, where we savored Kerala specialties like Ularthiyathu beef which is beef, slow-roasted in a mixture of spices, onions, curry leaves, and coconut slivers, and then fried in coconut oil. By this time we were starting to get used to eating with our hands!

## The Wedding Day

Finally, the much-anticipated wedding day arrived! Excitement filled the air as we woke up and prepared for the full day of celebrations. My husband wore his new kurta, and I wore my traditional Chinese Qipao, feeling honored to be a part of this special day! We made our way to the Trivandrum Club, which was beautifully decorated with vibrant flowers and intricate designs. Upon arrival, we were offered one of an array of delightful flavors of tea. We were greeted by our friend, the groom, and his family. The atmosphere was filled with joy as the guests arrived and chatted. The ceremony was held in Malayalam with a few words of English, and was filled with warmth and hospitality. After the ceremony, the bride and groom changed into their second stunning outfits (a traditional part of Indian weddings). Throughout the event, numerous photographers documented every moment, including with the use of a drone! We were even asked to record a message for the bride and groom, which added a fun twist to the day.

Uncertain whether each person we approached was going to be able to speak English or not made for an adventurous rest of the day. We got to make many new friends! As the festivities continued, we enjoyed watching the choreographed dances, and before we knew it, it was late into the afternoon, and we were getting hungry. We wandered into another room and found a generous buffet for the guests featuring an array of curries, breads, biryani, and desserts. Despite our hesitation, it was insisted by the caterer that we sit at the bridal party table. We were treated to a feast, with servers offering us dish after dish, after which we were asked to make a video review for the catering business. That’s what happens when you are some of the only foreigners at an Indian wedding I guess! We enjoyed more conversations, tea, and said our farewells and well wishes to our friend and his new bride. The day was filled with new friendships, unexpected situations, and unforgettable memories.

## Last Day Adventures

On our final day, we headed to Golden Sand Beach in Poovar, about an hour south. Our Uber driver warned us that the beach location was off the beaten path, but we were eager to explore. The beach was stunning, with soft sand and palm trees lining the coast, but sadly, it was marred by loads of trash. Colorful boats dotted the shore, and we encountered some protective beach dogs, one of which chased us for a bit—definitely a scary moment!

As we walked through a small town, we received curious stares and some friendly smiles from the locals. When I saw a small group of children approaching us, I suddenly remembered the two handfuls of candy a sweet little grandma had forced into my purse a week earlier. The children were so excited! It made my whole day.

Eventually, we reached the point where the Neyyar River meets the Arabian Sea. Intrigued by the scenery, we decided to take a boat tour through the backwaters and mangroves. For just $11, we enjoyed an hour-long ride, spotting various birds and soaking in the serene beauty of the area. We saw Tibetan Sand Plovers, Asian Openbill Storks, Brahminy Kites, Kingfishers, Common Flameback Woodpeckers, Black Darters…and some Long Eared Goats!

After the boat ride, we faced a bit of a challenge finding transportation back. After some walking and a few attempts to catch an Uber, we finally found an auto rickshaw that agreed to take us home. We ended our day at the Velvet Dawn Cafe, a super charming little restaurant that had been converted from a house to a restaurant and had western and Indian fusion cuisine. Our waiter was from Meghalaya, a beautiful region in northeastern India, and we enjoyed chatting with him about his home.

As we walked back to our Airbnb, we stopped at a small shop selling fried Indian snacks and tea, where we chatted with the locals and practiced a few words in Malayalam, Tamil, and Hindi. Exhausted but happy, we returned home, ready to crash after an incredible week in Kerala.
