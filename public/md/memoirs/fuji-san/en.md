# The Hike to Fuji San

## Introduction

Mt. Fuji is Japan’s highest peak, rising to 12,389 ft, and is an iconic symbol of the country. It is around 60 miles southeast of Tokyo, where our adventure began. We flew into Haneda Airport, where we would be meeting my parents, who would be arriving later in the day. We enjoyed a pleasant few hours strolling and eating ramen in the “Edo-Koji”, a themed shopping and dining area of the airport that features traditional buildings and streets that evoke the charm of historical Japan. By the early evening we were all on a bus headed for our first destination…Fujikawaguchiko.

## The Base

Fujikawaguchiko is a town near the northern base of Mount Fuji. It is part of the Fuji Five Lakes region and is known for its stunning views of the mountain and natural beauty surrounding Lake Kawaguchiko. We arrived to our very authentic Japanese styled accommodations, a hostel with private bedrooms and a shared kitchen and showers. It was spotless, with minimalist decor, sliding doors, and tatami mats. The next morning we made our way, sleepy eyed, up to a small lookout deck on top of the hostel to get our first breathtaking glimpse in daylight of Mt. Fuji over the rooftops. We got some bus passes and spent that day and the text exploring the surrounding area and lakes, taking the ropeway to an observation deck with panoramic views, spelunking, eating green tea ice cream, hiking through forests and near lakesides, enjoying the flower gardens at Oishi park, and trying the hearty local hoto noodles. We had one final day left in the area before returning to Tokyo. “What do you think, should we do it?” The excitement of the moment hung in the air, of just being there, of the weather being perfect despite being at the tail end of the season… I remember looking down at the only pair of walking shoes I had brought - my Chaco sandals - “Sure, let’s do it!” And so we decided, we would hike Mt. Fuji the following day!

## The Hike

We woke up early, and caught the first bus around 6am for a 45 minute ride to the 5th station of Mt. Fuji, at an elevation of 7,577 ft. Feeling the chill in the air, I found some Mt. Fuji themed souvenir toe socks to pair with my “Slippperrrrrrs”, as many local people pointed out in shock as we passed them, and we began our ascent up the Yoshida Trail to the Peak of Mt. Fuji! 

The day was turning out to be absolutely beautiful - blue skies, sunshine, and the crisp mountain air. We were repeatedly reminded to bring our own water, or purchase water at lower stations, since the refreshments got more pricey the higher up you go! The path began as a very wide dirt and gravel trail. As we ascended, it gradually narrowed becoming more rocky and steep. As we passed the 6th station, 7th station, our untrained lungs struggled in the thinner air, but we were determined! By this point my parents were slowing down and told us to go on, and they would continue the best they could. So, we pressed on, using the guide rope on the sides at the extra steep spots. As we stopped to catch our breath, we’d take in the grandeur around us, briefly greet our fellow hikers, and look with a mixture of envy and pity at those carrying large backpacks who’d be spending the night at one of the various mountain huts along the trail. By the 8th station, we were already above the clouds, and by the 9th, we were hiking in and out of a mist. It seemed we were making pretty good time, since we already made it to the second to last station by 11:45am! An hour later, we were at the peak! 

We hardly noticed the bite of the wind and strength of the sun (but we would regret not having worn sunscreen a few days later when we had the worst wind/sunburns of our lives). We explored the summit, past the Kumotori Shrine, walking around 2,600 foot rim of the giant crater, taking pictures from various viewpoints with stunning vistas, feeling like we were on top of the world! After thoroughly exploring the summit, and unsure if parents were still on their way, we decided to take a well deserved cat nap on some benches nearby the top of the trailhead. Unbeknownst to us, my mom had decided she had made it as far as she could at the 8th station, and my dad had decided to press on. He made it all the way to the 9th station, but realized there wouldn’t be time to make it to the top and back down in order to catch the bus back from the 5th station to town. So when my parents hadn’t arrived by about 3pm, we decided it was time to start our descent. (I’m just going to make this side note to say how stinking proud I am of my parents for hiking Mt. Fuji in their late 50’s on a spur of the moment decision nonetheless. They succeeded 100%, reached their own personal Mt. Fuji summits, which is making it to the top in my book.)

## The Descent

The trail heading down was steep and gravelly, and let’s just say that was not working well with the small rocks getting stuck in my sandals. Once we successfully met up with my parents, exchanged stories, and continued hiking down, we decided to take one of the other merging trails to avoid the steep gravel. The trail we chose was good in that it wasn’t slippery or easy to get things in your shoes, but it was taking us much longer since we had to slowly climb down boulders. We also soon realized that it seemed we were the only ones descending on this trail, everyone else was ascending and were ones who would be spending the night on the mountain. From this point I don’t have any more pictures or even remember what the name of the trail we took down was, because one thought became increasingly more urgent as the sun began to dim in the sky…”Don’t miss the last bus!” This thought also became verbalized by various passerby as they made way for us to awkwardly scramble down the rocks. The last bus left at 8:10pm. We made it on just minutes before it departed. As the adrenaline began to wear off, the events of the day settled in our mind…we just hiked Mt. Fuji! We made it back to our hostel, and washed up and stumbled into our dorm room tatami beds, exhausted and triumphant.

## Conclusion

Hiking Mt. Fuji was definitely the highlight of our Japan trip. The surrounding areas are beautiful, lush, and serene. And the hike through the clouds and changing landscape of forests, rocky paths, and volcanic terrain is a profound and exhilarating experience. It was an experience that left us in awe (and wanting to come back and spend the night on the mountain to experience the sunrise hike). We’ll save that for next time. So, if you ever find yourself at the base of Mt. Fuji with only a pair of Chacos on your feet, and a question in your heart, the answer is yes. Hike the mountain.
