## Introduction

When people travel to Türkiye, they think of the Grand Bazaar, Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, Pamukkale, Cappadocia, döner, tea, Turkish delights, and so much more. While those are noteworthy places, there are regions in Türkiye that are less well-known, less explored, and distinctly different. We are talking about Eastern Türkiye, where the people are mostly Kurdish, the tourists are often Iranian, and you feel like you’ve stepped back in time by 100 years.

## Lake Van

When a person is constantly traveling, they tend to try and forget the days spent traveling and instead enjoy the moments that open up to them. The moment the sky opened up and below the aircraft was the calmness of water, with the sun shining on it as if it was the first time it had shone. A lonely island, missing its inhabitants, and a tarmac waiting for us to land created a moment that one can't forget. The thought of visiting that lonely island was something that made the list of things to do, and as the registered thought turned into reality, it gave way to an opportunity to see something truly breathtaking. It wasn’t just what was on the island—though the historical church provided interesting insights into the history of the people in this region over the last few hundred years—but what was truly amazing was the view looking back at the mainland. Peering over the alkaline lake, where most things simply cannot live, was a glimpse into a place where life seems to take its first breaths.

### Key Moments

- The breathtaking view of Lake Van from the air, with its deep blue waters contrasting against the stark landscape.

- The serene atmosphere of Akdamar Island, where the historical church stands as a testament to the region's rich cultural heritage.

- The realization of how isolated yet beautiful this part of Türkiye is, evoking a sense of peace and reflection.

## Mount Ararat

Northeast of Lake Van is a place called Doğubayazıt. The settlement of this area goes back thousands of years, even beyond the modern Turkish name as we know it today. Bordering Iran and just to the north of Armenia, this place has a history of conflict and new beginnings of historical proportions. In our recent modern history, this location boasts one of the most interestingly preserved Ottoman palaces. My first steps into Ishak Pasha Palace coincided with a work appointment that I needed to keep. As one of the locals serving tea approached me, despite my being too busy to engage in a hospitable conversation, he smiled and served me, giving me the customary &quot;rica ederim&quot; in response to my thanks. This led me to the moment of realizing that despite any work problems I was experiencing, I was at the foothills of Mount Ararat working. What better office could one ask for, all by accident? The lesson here is to be content with life despite circumstances or issues. There are perks to any situation; maintaining a positive attitude can go a long way. Ishak Pasha Palace is an impressive example of Ottoman life during the 16th century. Being largely intact and well-maintained today, many travelers appreciate the ingenuity and marvel of creating something so intricate out of stone.

### Key Moments

- The awe-inspiring architecture of Ishak Pasha Palace, which stands as a symbol of the region's rich history.

- The warmth and hospitality of the local people, which provided a comforting contrast to my busy schedule.

- The realization that even amidst work obligations, one can find beauty and inspiration in their surroundings.

## Nemrut

While Mount Ararat was truly an amazing experience, Nemrut (meaning Nimrod in English) is steeped in history, reminding us of beauty and wonder. Nemrut is a volcano, and my time there left me wanting more. As a place I had not heard of until my journey in Eastern Türkiye, the adventure of no borders and boundaries was an experience that made me feel both alone and liberated. The beauty itself is nothing short of extraordinary. As the snow fell, the trees changed color, and the thunderous sky crackled with its voice, lightning struck as it saw fit. The quiet sounds contrasting with the sky's roar made me realize how small one can feel in such a freeing place. Viewing the crater lakes and exploring for hot springs gave me a longing to return one day to discover what else there was to explore. The freeing experience left me wanting more and is something that will stick in my mind until the next time.

### Key Moments

- The breathtaking sight of the snow-capped peaks of Nemrut, contrasting with the vibrant colors of the changing leaves.

- The powerful feeling of solitude amidst nature, where the only sounds were the elements themselves.

- The discovery of hidden hot springs, which provided a unique and rejuvenating experience in the heart of the wilderness.

## Van

Van is the place where one may decide to stay in Eastern Türkiye. While both Van and Tat Van are options for accommodations, Van would be considered the bigger city with more to offer. My first steps in Van felt like stepping back in time, back to a period where life was simpler and people were more important than things to the majority. The culture and language of the Kurdish people are distinct from the Turks, and their lifestyle piqued my interest. People filled the streets, drinking tea, engaging in conversations, and playing games. The locals seemed to enjoy life, or at least it appeared that way. The reality is that people everywhere have problems, but witnessing the joy in their interactions and the importance they placed on family brought smiles to their faces. This is a part of the experience of a trekker—finding beauty in the everyday lives of others.

### Key Moments

- The vibrant atmosphere of Van's streets, filled with laughter and the aroma of freshly brewed tea.

- The warmth of the Kurdish community, who welcomed me with open arms and shared their stories.

- The contrast between the bustling city life and the serene landscapes surrounding Van, reminding me of the beauty in both nature and human connection.
