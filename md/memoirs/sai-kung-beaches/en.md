# The Beaches of Hong Kong

## Introduction

When you think of Hong Kong, you may think of a bustling city, the “pearl of the Orient,” a vibrant metropolis teeming with global commerce, and you’re right! Hong Kong is a thriving multicultural city, a mixture of modernity integrally interwoven with traditional Chinese culture. But that’s not all. It is also a place of lush greenery, dramatic vistas, endless hiking trails, wildlife, waterfalls, rock pools, and stunning beaches with crystal blue waters.

## Chunking Mansions

Around the time we first started exploring Hong Kong, we spent a few weeks in the belly of the beast, a place called “Chunking Mansions,” a city within a city, a place deserving its own blog, filled with a dizzying array of guesthouses, shops, restaurants, money-changing stations, etc. Not what we expected, but definitely an adventure in itself. After being cooped up in such a small and crowded place, we were itching to find wide open spaces. So we started researching hikes in Hong Kong.

## The Hike to Paradise

We stumbled across directions for a hike along the famous Maclehose Trail that boasted traversing four different bays with beautiful overlooks and stunning beaches in Sai Kung. We were sold! We set out on our adventure, taking the subway, a green minibus, and a public double-decker bus until we finally made it to the starting point of our hike. After an easy hour hike, we made it to the first beach with a small village with shacks to stop and get snacks and drinks. It was nice, but we weren’t stopping there. We crossed the beach and made the ascent up and up into the blue skies until we made it, breathless and sweating, to a peak and slowly started descending and winding around. When the first glimpses of the second beach came into view, we were in awe. The endless white sand disappearing into the dazzling blue waters against the dramatic background of mountains and lush greenery looked nothing short of paradise. After drinking in the views for a few minutes, we excitedly made our way down the steps and threw off our shoes as our toes hit the soft, fine sand. It was glorious, and we nearly had the entire beach to ourselves! We spent a few hours here soaking up the sun and swimming in the South China Sea, feeling like we were in a completely different world than the crowded city we’d been in just a few hours previously. We made our way across the small, rickety wooden bridge to the snack stall overlooking the beach and got an ice-cold beer. I don’t even think we made it to the next beach on that first visit; we were in such disbelief and wonder at the beauty of what we had discovered.

### Key Moments

- The quest for serene and untainted natural expanses.

- The breathtaking views of beaches and mountains along the Maclehose Trail.

- The sense of wonderment and discovery as the second Paradise-like beach came into view.

## Beaches Continued

Since that first time, we’ve made this hike over and over again, exploring deeper and further. We discovered the trail that led to the third beach, an even longer, more secluded, and equally beautiful beach. From the end of this beach, you can again ascend upwards into the thicker and wilder brush with a less identifiable trail that eventually leads to a rock face with a small climb down a rope to the fourth and final beach below.

### Key Moments

- The pull for coming back to this place to explore more and the discovery of even more secluded beaches.

- The powerful feeling of solitude amidst nature, where the only sounds were the elements themselves.

## The Journey Back

From the snack shop at the second beach, you can follow a trail that will lead you through old and abandoned buildings, eerie and enchanting, whispering of times gone by, of knotted trees and winding pathways. Here, nature is king, and amidst the trees and dirt are, often hidden, cobras, giant spiders, monkeys, giant centipedes, bright blue butterflies, and crabs, to name a few. After about two hours of hiking, the day catches up to you, and tiredness sets into your bones, the sun's rays having soaked into your skin, your saltwater-dried hair. Finally, you make it to the trail end and make the short walk to the bus stop. The bus takes you back to Sai Kung town, the quaint and charming coastal town known for its fresh seafood restaurants, boating activities, eclectic boutiques, and relaxed atmosphere. After some much-needed dinner, we make our way back to the city, happily exhausted.
